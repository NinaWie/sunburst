# Visualizations of multiple categorical variables

I created different plots to present categorical data of certain forms in a nice way.

## Sunrays plot

In an attempt to create a visualization as a graphic I found [here](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/colours-in-cultures/), I created a similar representation with matplotlib. Follow the instructions in the noteook to replace the example data with your own.

## Sunburst plot

I used some code from Stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12926779/how-to-make-a-sunburst-plot-in-r-or-python> for a project and changed coloring and some other stuff to make the usage easier. Only the Jupiter notebook is required to import your data and make a sunburst plot.
