# Sunburst

I used some code from Stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12926779/how-to-make-a-sunburst-plot-in-r-or-python> for a project and changed coloring and some other stuff to make the usage easier. Only the Jupiter notebook is required to import your data and make a sunburst plot.
